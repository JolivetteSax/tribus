Design alternatives collaboration and tracking software


## Alternatives

Alternatives are the language of design. When a design decision is made, it is always between at least 2 alternatives. 

## Communication and Decision making

Reflecting the fact that human communication is at-most trinary (speaker, listener, and translator/explainer), decisions are most effective when a nominator and confirmer roles are clearly defined. 

Human communication can be most effectively deployed when humans have both group anonymity and accountability. 

## Use Cases

A problem is to be solved. This problem or need or preference may be articulated by any member, or external trusted source.
 1. Someone is made to be the single accountable decision maker. 
 1. A 'tribus' or set-of-three is formed. The group's membership is transparent
 1. The group may message one another within a chat window. Each person's messages are tied to an anonymized handle for this tribus
 1. Individuals propose alternatives into the basket, or hopper of ideas. 
 1. The group votes on each alternative
 1. Once this voting is completed, the alternative list is presented as a set of ranked choices to the decision maker
 1. The decision maker may accept/confirm or request something different, which re-opens discussion and voting
 1. Additional workflow may be part of the result, including implementation links (commits), unit testing, notes, QA testing status, production deployment status etc.
